## Business Problem
The goal of this project is to understand the data as it relates to the products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.  

### Data
The initial data contained 8,523 rows of data and 11 columns of variables that could impact sales and 1 column of target sales value data.   You can download the data using this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view).  The original source of the [data.](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/)

## Methods
First, we made a copy of the original data.  We dropped duplicated rows.  We then visually inspected the data and discovered missing data points in product weight and outlet size.  We imputed the data for the missing rows "Item Weight" by taking the average of the weights of same product types.  We also imputed the values for outlet size as "Unknown" so as not to dirty the actually complete data points.  We looked at correlations between the various factors and the "Item_Outlet_Sales."  We then created univariate and multivariate visuals to understand the data. 

We did exploratory data visualization analysis of: 

1)  Correlation heat map between the numeric data points which yielded a high correlation between MRP and our target "item outlet sales"
2)  Box plot of MRP and product type 
3)  Bar chart of outlet type versus item outlet sales
4)  Scatter chart of MRP and item outlet sales with outlet type (and also outlet size) in color
5)  Many other visualizations with varying degree of usefullness

### Examples of the visualizations

Due to the clear importance of MRP and item outlet sales, we explored a box plot of MRP by product type

This scatter plot shows MRP and item outset sales on the x and y axes, respectively, and outlet type in color

Based on our analysis, we determined that MRP and outlet size were the most important values.  However, we ran a regression with all the data and one hot encoded ("OHE") the object columns and scaled the numeric columns.  The results were a very poor fit with an astronomical error value largely because of the numerous columns generated by the OHE data.  Upon further analysis, we determined that the object columns 'Item_Identifier', 'Outlet_Identifier', 'Item_Weight' , 'Outlet_Establishment_Year' we not correlated with our target of item outlet sales and dropped them from the analysis.

We went back to the original data, dropped the uncorrelated columns, and then split the original data into a train data set and test data set.  Since we had dropped the item weight column we didn't have to impute the missing weights.  However, we did still fill in the missing outlet size data with "Unknown."  Since we had dropped the columns with many object fields, we one hot encoded the object data and scaled the numeric data for standardization.

 
## Model

We ran three regressions - a linear regression, simple regression tree, and random forest regression.  The random forest regression was the best fit when tuned with max depth of 5 and n-estimators of 270.  

The regression yielded an R2 of .603.  It did not overfit the data as measured by the difference in R2 between training and testing. 

The average target value of item outlet sales was ₹2,181 (values in rupees).  The mean absolute error ("MAE") for the test data set was ₹729 which represents 33.4%.    

The root mean squared error ("RMSE") was ₹1,047 which while a bit higher than the MAE indicated that there are not a lot of large outliers which would drive the RMSE higher. 

All in, the Random Forest Regressor was the best fit of the data compared to the simple linear regression and the simple regression tree.

## Limitation, Recommendations, and Next Steps

The Random Forest Regressor yielded good not great results.  As measured by R2, the model explains about 60% of the variation in the data.  With greater data preprocessing and more sophisticated data tools we can likely do better.  We should continue to look at other options and data processing for improvement.  We need to rub some funk on it! 

## Additional Information Concerning the Regression

We ran two additional regressions of the sales data. The first was a linear regression which yielded several top important features with the following coefficients:

#### Linear Regression

![Regression Coefficients](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215608702-30b5b6d8-cc7a-43f3-b0f4-16da1b0f4b31.png)

These coefficients mean that for every unit increase in each underlying feature value, the projected sale of that product increses by these amounts.  For instance, for every unit increase in Item_MRP, the total sales of that product increases by 984.31.  This is also true for the outlet type.  However, outlet type is a categorical value so it is either a one or a zero depending on whether or not the store is that type.  For instance, if the outlet type is a supermarket type 3 the total sales volume would be projected to be 3,365.88 as a baseline.  This is clearly a crude limitation of the simple regression model.  

##### Feature Importance

![Linreg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215377220-f003e105-d349-4e06-8712-05456571a25c.png)

The most impactful features are the outlet type - Type 1, 2, or 3 and the sale price of the object. When predicting the sale of an item, the size and by implication the volume of products sold, have a large impact on the total sales of the product.

#### Random Forest Regressor

![forestreg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215377549-fce3a2a0-5940-4c94-8fe4-4c205b9ce979.png)

Based on both 'importance' and 'permutation importance' the top five features per the Random Forest Regressor are item_MRP, outlet size (1, 2, and 3), and Item_Visibility.  

##### SHAP Feature Analysis

In addition to looking at feature 'importance' and 'permutation importance' I performed a SHAP analysis.  The SHAP analysis is another way to measure the importance of the various features to the regression.  

![shap_bar_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215603267-edb97d61-9a1b-4803-8705-6cce4ca8fc13.png)

The top features measured by permutation importance in descending order are Supermarket type 3, item_MRP, Supermarket type 1, and Supermarket type 2.  The top features measured by SHAP are item_MRP, Supermarket type 1, Supermarket type 3, Supermarket type 2.  The top features are the same but the order of them is different.

![summary_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215603725-6bb33226-3958-4e02-83ed-92258580ca15.png)

Per Shap, the most important four features are item_MRP, Supermarket type 1, Supermarket type 3, Supermarket type 2.  

For item_MRP, as the price of the item increases, the total sales volume of the items increases.  

Supermarket type are all categorical features.  If the store is a supermarket type 3, the sales volume increases significantly.  This would imply that supermarket 3 is the highest volume supermarket.  If the supermarket is type 1 or 2, the sales volume increases but not as much as for type 3.  

##### Local Explanations

I performed a Lime and a force plot analysis of the highest volume and lowest volume sample. 


###### Lowest


![Lime Lowest Volume](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215900675-f8432a57-fd1d-4549-9dd1-0f8681057246.png)

Per the Lime analysis, the product with the lowest sales volume had features that were associated with both a higher and lower sales volume.

- Outlet type - There are three possibilities for outlet type - Supermarket 1, 2, 3 or grocery store. This product was sold in a grocery store which is associated with the lowest sales volume of all outlet types.
- The item had a low MRP which is associated with low sales
- The type of item was a categorical that was one hot encoded.  This means that what type of item it was (or wasn't) had both positive and negative influences on the sales volume.  However, the outlet type and MRP had a much greater impact than item type.

![Force Plot Lowest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215900702-8591c97c-1000-4897-8ff3-115fa96a8c61.png)

Per the Shap force plot, the items that had the most impact were
- The fact that it wasn't supermarket 1
- The fact that it wasn't supermarket 2
- The fact that it wasn't supermarket 3
- The item's MRP

This is consistent with the lime analysis.


###### Highest


![Lime Hightest Volume](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215900829-749c8d1d-4b60-42bb-954b-7171a0600480.png)

Per the Lime analysis, the highest sales volume item also had features that were associated with higher and lower sales volumes:

- The factor that had the greatest influence on sales volume was the item MRP
- The second


- The factor that had the greatest influence on sales volume was the Item MRP
- The second most important factor was that the item was sold in a Supermarket type 3
- Similar to the lowest sales volume item, the type of product it was make an impact both positively and negatively. However, the outlet type and MRP had a much greater impact than item type.

![Force Plot Highest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113855848/215900843-af3db182-5288-4efb-a026-fa9e44b11162.png)

Per the individual force plot:

- The factor that had the greatest influence on sales volume was that the item was sold in a Supermarket type 3
- The second most important factor was the item MRP
- Interestingly, item visibility was the third most important factor 

This is similar to the Lime analysis with the exception of item visibility.
